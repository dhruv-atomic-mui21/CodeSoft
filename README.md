# CodeSoft Project Repository

Welcome to the CodeSoft repository! This repository contains multiple projects organized into main directories. 

These projects are part of the CodeSoft internship program, where interns work on diverse AI and machine learning applications to build practical skills and contribute to real-world projects.

Each project has its own dedicated folder with its own README for detailed information.
